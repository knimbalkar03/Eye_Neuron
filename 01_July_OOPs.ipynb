    "\n",
    "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to organize software in a manner that mimics real-world objects or concepts, making it easier to create, maintain, and scale complex systems. OOP achieves this by representing data and behavior as objects that interact with each other.\n",

    "Encapsulation\n",
    "Inheritance\n",
    "Polymorphism\n",
    "Abstraction"

    "\n",
    "In Python, an object is a fundamental concept that represents a specific instance of a data structure or class. Everything in Python is an object, including integers, strings, lists, functions, and even classes themselves.\n",
    "An object in Python consists of both data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data. These attributes and methods are accessed using dot notation (object.attribute or object.method()).\n"

    "\n",
    "In Python, a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It serves as a way to define the characteristics (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will have.\n",
    "Attributes are variables that hold data associated with the class or its instances, while methods are functions that perform actions or operations on the data within the class or its instances."

    "Attributes:\n",
    "Attributes are variables that hold data associated with the class or its instances (objects).\n",
    "They represent the state of the object and define its properties.\n",
    "Attributes are defined within the class and are accessed using dot notation (object.attribute).\n",
    "Each object of the class has its own set of attribute values.\n",
    "Attributes can be initialized in the constructor (__init__ method) or can be added dynamically.\n",
    "Methods:\n",
    "Methods are functions defined within a class that operate on the object's data.\n",
    "They represent the behaviors or actions that objects of the class can perform.\n",
    "Methods take at least one parameter, conventionally named self, which refers to the instance of the class.\n",
    "Methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()).\n",
    "They can interact with the object's attributes and modify their values.\n",
    "Methods can be classified as instance methods, class methods, or static methods based on their behavior.\n"

    "5. What is the difference between class variables and instance variables in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, class variables and instance variables are two types of variables used within a class, but they serve different purposes and have different scopes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Class Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "Class variables are variables that are shared among all instances (objects) of a class.\n",
    "They are defined within the class but outside of any methods.\n",
    "Class variables are accessed using the class name itself (ClassName.variable).\n",
    "They are typically used to store data that is common to all instances of the class.\n",
    "Modifications to class variables affect all instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Instance Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance variables are variables that are unique to each instance (object) of a class.\n",
    "They are defined within methods using the self keyword within the constructor (__init__) or any other method.\n",
    "Instance variables are accessed using the object name (object.variable) or self within methods.\n",
    "They store data specific to each object and can have different values for each instance.\n",
    "Modifications to instance variables affect only the specific instance they belong to."

    "6. What is the purpose of the self parameter in Python class methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the self parameter in class methods serves as a reference to the instance of the class itself. It allows methods to access and manipulate instance-specific data (attributes) and call other methods within the class. It's crucial for working with instance variables and maintaining the state of objects across method calls."
